Variables and Data Types: 
    Variables are used to store data in memory. 
    Python supports various data types such as 
    integers, 
    loats, 
    strings, 
    lists, 
    tuples, 
    dictionaries, 
    sets, 
    and more.

Operators: 
    Python supports a wide range of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), logical operators (and, or, not), assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=), and more.

Control Flow Statements:
    Conditional Statements: if, elif, else
    Looping Statements: for, while

Loop Control Statements: 
    break, continue, pass

Functions: 
    Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. Python allows defining functions using the def keyword.

Lambda Functions: 
    Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions defined using the lambda keyword.

Modules and Packages: 
    Python modules are files containing Python code. Packages are directories of Python modules. They help organize code and promote code reusability.

Classes and Objects: 
    Python is an object-oriented programming language, and classes are used to create objects. Classes encapsulate data and behavior into objects.

Inheritance: 
    Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. Python supports single and multiple inheritance.

Polymorphism: 
    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and code reuse.

Exception Handling: 
    Exception handling allows you to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution. Python provides try, except, else, and finally blocks for exception handling.

File Handling: 
    Python provides built-in functions and methods for reading from and writing to files. The open() function is used to open files, and methods like read(), write(), close(), etc., are used to perform file operations.

List Comprehensions: 
    List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They allow you to generate lists using a single line of code.

Generators: 
    Generators are functions that enable you to iterate over a sequence without storing the entire sequence in memory at once. They use the yield keyword to yield values one at a time.

Decorators: D
    ecorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to add functionality to existing functions or classes. They are widely used in frameworks like Flask and Django.

Concurrency and Parallelism: 
    Python supports various libraries and modules for concurrent and parallel programming, such as threading, multiprocessing, asyncio, and concurrent.futures.
