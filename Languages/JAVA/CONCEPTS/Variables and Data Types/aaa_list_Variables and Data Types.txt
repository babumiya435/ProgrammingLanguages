**********   List of Variables and Datatypes available in Java programming Language ************
In Java, variables are declared with a specific data type, which determines the type of data that can be stored in the variable. Here is a list of commonly used data types and variables in Java:

Primitive Data Types:

Java has eight primitive data types:

byte: 8-bit integer data type.
short: 16-bit integer data type.
int: 32-bit integer data type.
long: 64-bit integer data type.
float: 32-bit floating-point data type.
double: 64-bit floating-point data type.
char: 16-bit Unicode character data type.
boolean: Represents true or false values.

Reference Data Types:

Reference data types are used to refer to objects:

Object: The root class of all Java classes.
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
Array: Represents a collection of elements of the same type.
Class: Represents a class or interface.
Interface: Represents a reference to an interface.
Enumeration: Represents a set of named constants.
Arrays:

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type:

int[]: Array of integers.
double[]: Array of doubles.
String[]: Array of strings.
Object[]: Array of objects.
User-Defined Data Types:

User-defined data types are created using classes and interfaces:

class: Defines a blueprint for creating objects.
interface: Defines a contract for classes to implement.
enum: Defines a special data type for a set of constants.
package: Organizes classes and interfaces into namespaces.

Special Types:

Special types are used for specific purposes:
void: Represents the absence of a return value.
null: Represents the absence of an object reference.
