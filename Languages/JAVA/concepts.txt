Variables and Data Types: 
    Declaring variables to store data and defining their types such as 
    int, 
    double, 
    boolean, etc.

Operators: 
    Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), logical operators (&&, ||, !), etc.

Control Flow Statements:
    Conditional Statements: if, else if, else, switch.
    
Looping Statements: 
    for, while, do-while, foreach.

Branching Statements: b
    reak, continue, return.

Methods (Functions): 
    Defining reusable blocks of code with parameters and return types.

Classes and Objects: 
    Creating blueprints for objects with fields (attributes) and methods (functions).

Inheritance: 
    Creating new classes based on existing classes, inheriting fields and methods.

Polymorphism: 
    The ability of objects to take on multiple forms, achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

Abstraction: 
    Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features of an object.

Encapsulation: 
    Wrapping data (fields) and methods within a single unit (class) and restricting access to certain components.

Interfaces: 
    Defining a contract for classes to implement, specifying method signatures without providing the implementation.

Packages: 
    Organizing classes into namespaces to prevent naming conflicts and enhance modularity.

Exception Handling: 
    Managing runtime errors and exceptions using try, catch, finally blocks.

Arrays: 
    Collections of variables of the same type accessed by an index.

Strings: 
    Representing sequences of characters, with various methods for manipulation.

Collections Framework: 
    Interfaces and classes for representing and manipulating collections of objects, such as List, Set, Map, etc.

Concurrency: 
    Handling multiple tasks simultaneously through threads, synchronization, and locks.

File I/O: 
    Reading from and writing to files using InputStream, OutputStream, Reader, Writer, etc.

Generics: 
    Writing classes and methods that can work with any data type.

Annotations: 
    Adding metadata to classes, methods, and other program elements for compile-time or runtime processing.

Lambda Expressions: 
    Anonymous functions that enable functional programming style.
