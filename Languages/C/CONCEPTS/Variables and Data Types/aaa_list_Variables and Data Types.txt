**********   List of Variables and Datatypes available in C programming Language ************
In C programming, variables are containers for storing data, and data types specify the type of data that can be stored in a variable. Here are the basic data types and variables available in C:

Basic Data Types:

int: Used for integer values (whole numbers).
char: Used for single characters or small integer values.
float: Used for floating-point numbers (decimal numbers).
double: Used for double-precision floating-point numbers (larger decimal numbers).
void: Represents an empty data type or absence of a type.

Modifiers:

short: Used to reduce the range of values stored in an integer.
long: Used to increase the range of values stored in an integer.
signed: Specifies that a data type can hold both positive and negative values.
unsigned: Specifies that a data type can hold only non-negative values (positive or zero).

Derived Data Types:

Arrays: Used to store a collection of elements of the same data type.
Pointers: Used to store memory addresses of other variables or functions.
Structures: Used to group together variables of different data types under a single name.
Unions: Similar to structures but share the same memory location for all members.
Enums: Used to define a set of named integer constants.

Qualifiers:

const: Specifies that a variable's value cannot be changed once initialized.
volatile: Indicates that a variable can be modified unexpectedly by external sources.

Variables in C are declared by specifying their data type followed by the variable name. 
For example:

int age;
char grade;
float salary;
double pi;
