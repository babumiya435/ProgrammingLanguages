**********   List of Variables and Datatypes available in Javascript programming Language ************
In JavaScript, variables can hold various types of data, and the language itself provides several built-in data types. Here's a list of variables and data types available in JavaScript:

Undefined:
    The undefined type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet.
Null:
    The null type represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Boolean:
    The boolean type represents a logical value indicating true or false.
Number:
    The number type represents numeric data, including integer and floating-point numbers.
String:
    The string type represents textual data enclosed within single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
Symbol:
    The symbol type represents unique identifiers that are used as property keys in objects.
BigInt:
    The bigint type represents arbitrary precision integers, allowing for the representation of larger numbers than the standard number type.
Object:
    The object type represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or symbols) and values can be of any data type, including other objects.
Function:
    Functions are a subtype of objects in JavaScript and represent executable code blocks that can be invoked.

Additionally, JavaScript provides the typeof operator, which can be used to determine the data type of a variable or expression at runtime. It returns a string indicating the data type of the operand.

Example usage of typeof:

typeof undefined;  // "undefined"
typeof null;       // "object" (historical quirk, should be "null")
typeof true;       // "boolean"
typeof 42;         // "number"
typeof 'hello';    // "string"
typeof Symbol();   // "symbol"
typeof BigInt(42); // "bigint"
typeof {};         // "object"
typeof function(){}; // "function"
