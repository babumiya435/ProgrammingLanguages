Variables and Data Types: 
    Variables are used to store data values. 
    JavaScript supports various data types such as 
    strings, 
    numbers, 
    booleans, 
    objects, 
    arrays, 
    functions, etc.

Operators: 
    JavaScript includes various operators such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, etc., for performing operations on data.

Control Structures: 
    JavaScript supports control structures like if...else, switch, while, do...while, for loops, etc., for controlling the flow of execution.

Functions: 
    Functions are blocks of code that can be defined and executed as needed. They allow for code reusability and modularization.

Objects and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 
    JavaScript is an object-oriented language where everything is an object. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, and you can create custom objects and classes using constructor functions or ES6 classes.

Prototypes and Inheritance: 
    JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Prototype chains allow for inheritance and object extension.

Arrays: 
    Arrays are used to store collections of data values. JavaScript arrays are dynamic and can hold elements of different data types.

Regular Expressions: 
    Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and searching within strings. JavaScript provides built-in support for regular expressions using the RegExp object.

Error Handling: 
    JavaScript includes try...catch...finally blocks for handling errors and exceptions in code.

DOM Manipulation: 
    JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically modify HTML elements, attributes, styles, etc., on web pages.

Events and Event Handling: 
    JavaScript enables event-driven programming, where code responds to user interactions and browser events such as clicks, keypresses, mouse movements, etc.

Asynchronous Programming: 
    JavaScript supports asynchronous programming using callbacks, Promises, and async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations such as AJAX requests, file I/O, etc.

Modules: 
    JavaScript modules allow for modularization of code, enabling better organization, encapsulation, and reuse of code.

Scope and Closures: 
    JavaScript has function scope and lexical scoping rules. Closures allow inner functions to access variables and parameters of outer functions, even after the outer function has finished executing.

ES6+ Features: 
    JavaScript continues to evolve with new features and enhancements introduced in ECMAScript specifications. ES6+ (ECMAScript 2015 and later) features include arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, default parameters, rest and spread operators, classes, modules, etc.
