2. Why do we use CSS?

 - before invension of css we used to add styles inside html only through inline styles and html attributes (using style tag).
Before the invention of CSS, styles were added to web pages directly within HTML through a combination of inline styles and HTML attributes. Here are the primary methods used:

### 1. **Inline Styles**

Styles could be applied directly to HTML elements using the `style` attribute. Each element that needed styling had to have the styles explicitly defined within it.

#### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Inline Styles Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: navy; font-family: Arial;">Hello, World!</h1>
    <p style="color: gray; font-size: 14px;">This is a paragraph styled with inline styles.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 2. **HTML Attributes**

Various HTML elements had specific attributes to define their appearance. These attributes were limited in scope and flexibility compared to modern CSS.

#### Examples:

- **Font Attributes**: The `<font>` tag was used to specify the font, color, and size of text.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Font Tag Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><font face="Arial" color="navy">Hello, World!</font></h1>
    <p><font color="gray" size="2">This is a paragraph styled with the font tag.</font></p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Background and Text Color Attributes**: The `bgcolor` and `text` attributes of the `<body>` tag were used to set background and text colors for the entire document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Background and Text Color Example</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white" text="black">
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph with background and text colors set.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- **Table Attributes**: The `<table>` tag had attributes like `border`, `cellpadding`, and `cellspacing` to control the appearance of tables.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Table Attributes Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>30</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

### Limitations of Pre-CSS Styling Methods:

1. **Repetition**: Inline styles and HTML attributes had to be repeated for each element, leading to redundant code and difficulty in maintaining consistency across a website.

2. **Maintenance**: Updating styles required changing the attributes or inline styles in multiple places, making maintenance cumbersome and error-prone.

3. **Limited Capabilities**: HTML attributes provided limited styling options compared to the comprehensive styling capabilities of CSS.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Mixing content and presentation made it harder to manage and update web pages. CSS introduced a clear separation between content (HTML) and presentation (CSS), promoting better web design practices.

The introduction of CSS revolutionized web development by addressing these limitations, providing a more powerful and efficient way to style web pages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) solves several significant problems that were prevalent in web development before its invention. Here are the main issues it addresses:

### 1. **Separation of Content and Presentation**
- **Problem**: Before CSS, HTML documents mixed content and presentation, making the code harder to read and maintain.
- **Solution**: CSS allows developers to separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), leading to cleaner, more maintainable code.

### 2. **Consistency Across Multiple Pages**
- **Problem**: Applying styles directly within HTML made it difficult to maintain a consistent look across multiple web pages.
- **Solution**: CSS enables the use of external style sheets that can be linked to multiple HTML documents, ensuring a consistent look and feel across a website.

### 3. **Reduction of Redundant Code**
- **Problem**: Inline styles and HTML attributes had to be repeated for each element, leading to redundancy and larger file sizes.
- **Solution**: CSS allows the definition of styles in one place, which can be applied to multiple elements, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.

### 4. **Improved Flexibility and Control**
- **Problem**: HTML attributes offered limited styling options, restricting design capabilities.
- **Solution**: CSS provides a wide range of styling options, including layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and more, giving designers greater flexibility and control over the presentation.

### 5. **Easier Maintenance**
- **Problem**: Updating styles embedded in HTML required changes in multiple places, making maintenance tedious and error-prone.
- **Solution**: With CSS, styles are centralized. Changes made in a CSS file automatically apply to all linked HTML pages, simplifying updates and maintenance.

### 6. **Enhanced Responsiveness**
- **Problem**: Before CSS, adapting web pages to different devices and screen sizes was challenging.
- **Solution**: CSS includes features like media queries, which allow web pages to be responsive and adapt to various devices and screen sizes, improving the user experience.

### 7. **Complex Layouts and Designs**
- **Problem**: Creating complex layouts using HTML alone was difficult and often required convoluted workarounds.
- **Solution**: CSS provides advanced layout capabilities with features like Flexbox, Grid, and positioning, enabling developers to create sophisticated and complex designs more easily.

### 8. **Accessibility**
- **Problem**: Inline styles and mixed content/presentation could hinder web accessibility.
- **Solution**: CSS helps improve accessibility by providing mechanisms to control the presentation without affecting the document structure, making it easier to create accessible web content.

### 9. **Reduced Bandwidth Usage**
- **Problem**: Repeated inline styles and large HTML files increased bandwidth usage and load times.
- **Solution**: CSS reduces file sizes and bandwidth usage by centralizing style definitions, allowing browsers to cache CSS files and apply them across multiple pages.

### 10. **Cascading and Inheritance**
- **Problem**: Without a unified system, managing style priorities and inheritance was cumbersome (complex).
- **Solution**: CSS's cascading and inheritance mechanisms allow for more manageable and predictable styling, enabling developers to define global styles and override them where necessary with minimal effort.

### Examples of CSS Solving These Problems:

- **External Style Sheets**: Apply a single stylesheet to multiple pages for consistent styling.
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ```

- **Media Queries**: Make web pages responsive.
  ```css
  @media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
      font-size: 14px;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Flexbox and Grid Layouts**: Create complex, flexible layouts.
  ```css
  .container {
    display: flex;
  }

  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
  }
  ```

CSS has fundamentally improved how we style and design web pages, addressing numerous limitations of pre-CSS methods and enabling the creation of modern, responsive, and maintainable websites.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be related to several data structures in computer science due to its hierarchical and rule-based nature. Here are a few key data structures and how they relate to CSS:

### 1. **Tree Structure**
CSS can be closely related to a tree structure, particularly the DOM (Document Object Model) tree, which represents the hierarchical organization of an HTML document. In the DOM tree:

- **Nodes**: Each HTML element is a node in the tree.
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Elements are nested within each other, creating parent-child relationships.
- **Inheritance**: CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to child elements, much like how properties propagate through a tree.

#### Example:
Consider the following HTML structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>Hello, World!</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
The corresponding DOM tree looks like this:
```
html
├── head
│   └── title
└── body
    └── div
        └── p
            └── "Hello, World!"
```

### 2. **Hash Table**
CSS can also be thought of as a hash table (or dictionary) where selectors are the keys and the associated style rules are the values. This structure allows for quick lookup and application of styles.

#### Example:
Consider the following CSS:
```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

p {
    color: gray;
}
```
This can be conceptualized as a hash table:
```
{
    "body": { "font-family": "Arial, sans-serif" },
    "p": { "color": "gray" }
}
```

### 3. **Cascade and Specificity as a Stack**
The cascading nature of CSS can be likened to a stack where rules are pushed onto the stack, and the last (most specific) rule is the one that gets applied. This is how CSS resolves conflicts when multiple rules apply to the same element.

#### Example:
```css
p {
    color: blue;
}

p.special {
    color: green;
}
```
If an element has both the `p` tag and the `special` class, the color green will be applied because the rule for `.special` is more specific and sits on top of the stack.

### 4. **Graph**
In a more complex sense, the relationships between different CSS rules and HTML elements can be represented as a graph, where:

- **Nodes**: Represent HTML elements.
- **Edges**: Represent the application of CSS rules.
- **Weighted Edges**: Can represent the specificity of the rules applied to elements.

### Visualizing CSS with Data Structures:
To visualize how CSS rules apply to HTML elements, you can consider the following:

- **HTML as a Tree Structure**: Visualizing the DOM as a tree helps understand how styles propagate through parent-child relationships.
- **CSS Rules as Key-Value Pairs**: Think of CSS selectors as keys in a hash table with their corresponding styles as values.
- **Conflict Resolution with a Stack**: Use a stack model to understand how the most specific (or last defined) CSS rules override others.

By relating CSS to these data structures, developers can better understand how styles are applied, inherited, and overridden, leading to more efficient and effective use of CSS in web development.
