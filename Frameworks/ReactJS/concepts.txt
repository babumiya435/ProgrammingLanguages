JSX (JavaScript XML): 
    JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly in JavaScript, making it easier to create UI components.
    
Components: 
    Components are the building blocks of React applications. They can be either functional components or class components.
    
Props (Properties): 
    Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child components.
    
State: 
    State is used to manage the internal data and UI state of a component. It allows components to re-render when the state changes.
    
Lifecycle Methods: 
    Lifecycle methods are methods that are called at different stages of a component's lifecycle, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
    
Hooks: 
    Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. The most commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef.
    
Event Handling: 
    React allows you to handle events, such as onClick, onChange, onSubmit, etc., using event handlers.
    
Conditional Rendering: 
    React allows you to conditionally render UI components based on certain conditions using if statements, ternary operators, or logical && operator.
    
Lists and Keys: 
    React provides a way to render lists of data using the map function. Keys are used to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
    
Forms: 
    React provides controlled components for form handling, where form elements like input, textarea, and select are controlled by React state.
    
Context API: 
    Context API allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
    
Higher-Order Components (HOCs): 
    HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality.
    
Render Props: 
    Render Props is a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
    
Error Boundary: 
    Error Boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree and logs those errors.
    
Virtual DOM (Document Object Model): 
    React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing the number of DOM manipulations.
    
Server-side Rendering (SSR): 
    SSR is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending the HTML to the client, which improves SEO and initial load time.
    
Static Site Generation (SSG): 
    SSG is the process of generating static HTML files for each page of a website at build time, which improves performance and SEO.
    
Code Splitting: 
    Code splitting is the process of splitting your code into smaller chunks and loading them only when needed, which improves performance by reducing initial bundle size.
    
Contextual APIs (e.g., React Router, Redux): 
    Libraries like React Router and Redux provide contextual APIs for managing routing and state in React applications.
    
Testing: 
    React applications can be tested using tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Enzyme for unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.
