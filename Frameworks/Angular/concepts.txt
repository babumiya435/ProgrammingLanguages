Components: 
    The building blocks of an Angular application, responsible for defining views and logic.
    
Templates: 
    HTML files associated with Angular components that define the UI structure.
    
Directives: 
    HTML attributes or elements that extend the functionality of HTML in Angular templates.
    
Data Binding: 
    Establishing a connection between the UI and the application logic to ensure synchronization of data.
    
Services: 
    Reusable components that encapsulate business logic and functionality to be shared across components.
    
Dependency Injection (DI): 
    A design pattern used in Angular to manage the dependencies of components and services.
    
Modules: 
    Containers for organizing related components, directives, pipes, and services into cohesive units.
    
Routing: 
    Navigating between different views and components based on the URL.
    
Forms: 
    Handling user input and validation using template-driven or reactive forms.
    
HTTP Client: 
    Making HTTP requests to fetch or send data to a server.
    
Pipes: 
    Transforming data in the template before displaying it to the user.
    
Interceptors: 
    Middleware used to intercept HTTP requests and responses to perform transformations or error handling.
    
Lifecycle Hooks: 
    Methods provided by Angular to execute logic at specific points in the lifecycle of a component.
    
Lazy Loading: 
    Loading modules and components asynchronously to improve application performance.
    
Testing: 
    Writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of Angular applications.
    
Authentication and Authorization: 
    Implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure Angular applications.
    
Internationalization (i18n): 
    Supporting multiple languages and locales in Angular applications.
    
State Management: 
    Managing application state using techniques such as services, RxJS, or state management libraries like NgRx or Akita.
    
Performance Optimization: 
    Techniques for improving the performance of Angular applications, such as tree shaking, lazy loading, and optimizing change detection.
    
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): 
    Rendering Angular applications on the server to improve performance and SEO.
